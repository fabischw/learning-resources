# phone tipps for tech 
If you're like me you really want to use every second of time you got for tech which is why I spent a lot of time testing out different apps and things, here's a list of most of these apps and other things to maximize productivity when you only got your phone


NOTES:
- these are ALL android apps and I do not know if they exist for iOS
- most of these things don't require you to be connected to the internet after you download them once (how awesome is that ðŸ˜Ž)
- If you have an internet connection you might want to check my useful website cheatsheet [here](./websites/list.md) as well


### IDE's / code editors:

| name | language | extra info |
|--|--|--|
| pydroid | python | really good IDE for python with neat features, comes with a interpreter and pip |
